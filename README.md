# Event Registration System using Spring Boot

## Introduction
This is a simple event registration system built using Spring Boot. It allows users to register for events, view event details, and manage registrations.

## Features
- User Registration: Users can register for the system by providing their details.
- Event Creation: Admins can create new events by providing event details such as name, date, time, and location.
- Event Registration: Users can register for events by providing their details and selecting the event they want to attend.
- Event Management: Admins can view, update, and delete events.

## Technologies Used
- Spring Boot
- Spring MVC
- Thymeleaf (for server-side rendering)
- Spring Data JPA (for data access)
- MySQL (or any other database of your choice)

## System Architecture
The system follows a typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:
- **Model**: Represents the data structure of the application, including entities such as User and Event.
- **View**: Defines the user interface, including HTML templates rendered by Thymeleaf.
- **Controller**: Handles incoming requests, processes data, and interacts with the database.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Import the project into your preferred IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
3. Configure the database connection in the `application.properties` file.
4. Run the application as a Spring Boot application.
5. Access the application through the specified URL (usually `http://localhost:8080`).

## Usage
- **User Registration**: Users can register for the system by providing their details.
- **Event Creation**: Admins can create new events by providing event details such as name, date, time, and location.
- **Event Registration**: Users can register for events by providing their details and selecting the event they want to attend.
- **Event Management**: Admins can view, update, and delete events.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement authentication and authorization for user and admin roles.
- Add email notifications for event registration and updates.
- Enhance the user interface with better styling and responsiveness.
- Implement pagination and filtering for event listings.
